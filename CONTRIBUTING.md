# Contribution Process

Before opening an issue, starting a discussion, or submitting a pull request,
please read through this document to familiarize yourself with the development
process.

## Technical Issues

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/tera-arise/arise/issues) is where all
*technical* bug reports and feature requests should be posted. Other community
areas are not appropriate for these as issues raised there are likely to be lost
or forgotten.

## Game Suggestions

Non-technical suggestions for the direction of the game design should be posted
on the
[discussion forum](https://github.com/tera-arise/arise/discussions/categories/suggestions).
If we decide to adopt a suggestion, an issue for the implementation of it will
be created by a member of the developer team.

## Contributing Code

You are welcome to submit 'trivial'
[pull requests](https://github.com/tera-arise/arise/pulls) that consist of typo
fixes, obvious bug squashing, documentation improvements, etc. However, until
the foundational design and direction of the project has solidified, we will
*not* be taking major contributions, such as feature work, from contributors
outside of the developer team.
